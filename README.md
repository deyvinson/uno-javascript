### Description
UNO game made entirely using javascript!
You can play the demo [HERE](http://play-uno.000webhostapp.com/).

In this game you play against 3 CPU opponents. The detailed rules can be viewed by the title screen of the game.
I made this game at the end work of m√Ω Computer Course. 
I used as a base [this code](https://code.sololearn.com/W87BXhQSl8Sv/#html). I worked really hard to improve it, as it barely resembles the initial.

### How-to-Use (What you need)
- Internet access (obviously)
- Google Chrome Installed (I tryed on other browsers, but the elements don't work properly. So, use Chrome!)

Preferably on desktop (mobile works too, but elements are bigger due to resolution used)

To use offline:
- Clone/download repository to your computer
- Open index.html.
