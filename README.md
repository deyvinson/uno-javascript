### Description
UNO game made entirely using javascript!
You can play the demo [HERE](http://play-uno.000webhostapp.com/). 

In this game you play against 3 CPU opponents. The detailed rules can be viewed by the title screen of the game. 

I made this game for end work of my Course, and used as a base [this code](https://code.sololearn.com/W87BXhQSl8Sv/#html). I worked really hard to improve it, as it barely resembles the initial. 



### How-to-Use (What you need)
- Internet access (obviously)
- Google Chrome Installed (I tryed on other browsers, but the elements don't work properly. So, use Chrome!)
- click the link at the main description (or just click [here](http://play-uno.000webhostapp.com/)).

To use offline:
- Clone/download repository to your computer
- Open index.html.

##### PS.: Preferably on desktop (mobile works too, but elements are bigger due to resolution used)
